Introduction:
With this program we would like to implement a solution that can recognize entity mentions in web
pages and link them to entities in the Wikidata knowledge base. As an input, the program will receive
a WARC file which is a common archive format containing a collection of web pages. The output will
be a list of entities along with the IDs of the web pages and Wikidata entities. We coded the program
in Python, taking advantage of many libraries that are documented in requirements.txtÍ¾ moreover we
made use of ElasticSearch and Trident which were already installed in the given Docker file.

Instructions to run the program:
1. Run setup.py to install all packages
2. In order to use ElasticSearch the vm.max_map_count should be increased to 262144
3. Run starter_code.py to run the program
